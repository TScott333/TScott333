- 👋 Hi, I’m @TScott333
- 👀 I’m interested in spatial statistics and machine learning in the geology/mining environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create machine learning models that allow me to predict response variables from several primary input variables. I'm also quite new to the Python environment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automated/scripted ways of conducting an EDA, visualising and understanding multivariate data, and the use of machine learning to understand and predict multivariate data.
